# About The Collection

I share my name (phonetically, at least) with someone who was really special to me: Ayne Howard, my husband's grandmother, who we also called Teddy. 

She saved many things over the course of her life, and I am grateful to now be in possession of some family photos that were precious to her. After digitizing them, I created this site for sharing with you! Thank you for visiting.

 This selection of photos was recovered from the personal collection of Ayne Howard (a.k.a. Teddy) after she passed in 2023. Teddy was very dedicated to her parents, and loved her father very much -- so much so that her second grandson (my husband) was named after him. 

Some notes:
- The dates are approximate, with a few exceptions
- Some subjects are unknown, and have been listed as sibling/cousin
- The photographer is listed for a few of the formal portraits; however, in most cases, the photographer is unknown.

 Although we never met, I feel I am able to better understand Benjamin Sword through these images. I hope you enjoy browsing the collection, which to me demonstrate a full and happy life in the American West in the mid-twentieth century.
